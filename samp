Once upon a time, there was a very poor girl, but nobody loved her. The girl lived alone, but she needed to have a friend. After some time, she met a very rich girl who was a very humble person. They began to talk and soon became very good friends.
In a small village, there lived a hardworking farmer who had two sons, Ram and Shyam. The brothers constantly fought over everything, refusing to cooperate. Their father, concerned about their endless arguments, wanted to teach them a lesson about unity.

One day the farmer gathered a bundle of sticks and asked his sons to break them. Ram, the stronger of the two, tried first. Despite his strength, he couldn’t break the bundle. Shyam, too, tried, but the sticks wouldn’t break.

The farmer then untied the bundle and handed each son a single stick. “Now try,” he said. Both Ram and Shyam easily broke the single sticks in their hands.

Their father explained, “Individually, you can break a single stick easily, but when together, the sticks are unbreakable. The same goes for both of you. If you keep fighting and remain divided, you will be weak and vulnerable. But if you work together and support each other nothing can break your bond.”

The brothers understood their father’s wisdom and from that day forward, worked together in harmony. Their friendship and teamwork grew stronger, and they became inseparable, realizing that unity made them more powerful.
